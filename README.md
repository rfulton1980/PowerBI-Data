# PowerBI-Data
# Roderick Fulton‚Äôs Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! I‚Äôm Roderick Fulton, an experienced Data Engineer specializing in end-to-end pipeline development, data modeling, and cloud-scale analytics. This repository showcases three complete Power BI template projects along with their Functional & Technical Requirement Documents, demonstrating my ability to design robust data architectures, build reliable ETL/ELT processes, and deliver high-performance dashboards that scale across enterprise environments. These examples reflect the kinds of data engineering challenges I solve daily.

## Why I‚Äôm a Strong Data Engineering Candidate

- **End-to-End ETL/ELT Expertise**  
  Designed and orchestrated data pipelines using Power Query and Azure Data Factory to ingest hundreds of millions of rows, ensuring data accuracy, lineage, and auditability.
- **Cloud Data Platform Proficiency**  
  Built and managed Snowflake and SQL Data Warehouse environments, optimizing storage, clustering, and compute for sub-second query performance at scale.
- **Data Modeling & Schema Design**  
  Applied star and snowflake schemas in Azure Synapse Analytics and Databricks to support both dimensional reporting and ad-hoc analytics.
- **Performance & Cost Optimization**  
  Implemented partitioning, incremental loads, and aggregated tables. Tuned queries and DAX measures, reducing refresh times by 70% and cutting compute costs by 40%.
- **CI/CD & Version Control**  
  Automated deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions, enforcing code reviews, unit tests, and documentation to guarantee production-ready deliverables.
- **Collaboration & Stakeholder Engagement**  
  Partnered closely with finance, PMO, and IT teams to gather requirements, define SLAs, and iterate rapidly based on feedback‚Äîdelivering business value on day one.
